## **Summary**

Parliamentary legislative bodies, named [Committees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Committees_of_the_United_Kingdom), are comprised of [Members of Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament) who are tasked with investigating particular subject matters through the use of a [public inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry). Calls for evidence are made, at the start of every inquiry, requesting members of the public to submit [written evidence](http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/Health/CQCwrittenev01-05.pdf) to the Committee that can assist them in their investigations. Witnessess are then subsequently drawn from this pool to submit oral evidence in front of a Committee.

There is an increasing desire for committees to track the diversity of witnesses to ensure that under-represented groups are given equal opportunity to present information in front of a Committee..

## **Problem**

Committees would like this data to become actionable so that they can see, from inquiry to inquiry, if witnesses tended to be skewed towards a particular demographic or gender and if so, redouble efforts to engage with and solicit witnesses from under-represented groups. During the term of a [Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom), Committees can initiate hundreds of inquiries that can in turn generate thousands of written evidence submissions. On average, Committees typically have only limited administrative resources to handle its processes so dedicating personnel to exclusively collate diversity witness data is currently burdensome.

## **Objective**

To determine scientifically through the use of machine learning, and data, if the submission process was fair and without bias. The conclusions of this project will be presented to Committees as part of Governmentâ€™s ongoing desire to improve representation amongst underrepresented groups and drive engagement among the general public.
